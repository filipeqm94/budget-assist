## Roadmap

The development of Budget Assist is ongoing, and several exciting features are planned for future releases to enhance user experience and functionality. Here’s what’s on the horizon:

- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** We are planning to introduce a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface that will allow users to easily rearrange the order of income, savings, and expense items. This feature will make budget management more intuitive and flexible.

- **User Authentication:** To ensure that users can securely access their data, we will implement user authentication features. This will include secure login processes, password protection, and the ability to handle multiple user profiles within a single application.

- **Customization Options:** Users will soon be able to fully customize their financial tracking by adding, removing, or editing income, savings, and expense items. This enhancement will provide greater control over budget categories and enable a more personalized budgeting experience.

These features are designed to make Budget Assist not only more interactive but also more secure and tailored to individual user needs. We are committed to continuous improvement and are excited to bring these enhancements to our users.
